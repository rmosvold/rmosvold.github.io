The [[https://cerme13.renyi.hu/][CERME 13 conference]] was held in Budapest, Hungary, in 2023. Even though the conference was arranged in the summer (July 10â€“14), the organizers have been able to finish the conference proceedings in record time. The full proceedings are now available at: http://erme.site/cerme-proceedings-series/

As the leader of TWG19, I obviously recommend the papers from that group, but there are many interesting papers to read, and the full proceedings constitute more than 5,000 pages. Happy reading!
