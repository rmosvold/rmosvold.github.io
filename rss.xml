  <title><![CDATA[Dilemmas of mathematics teaching]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
A little while ago, Fraser Gobede and I co-authored an article entitled, “Studying dilemmas of mathematics teaching in Southern Africa”. This article was inspired by the works of scholars like Magdalene Lampert and Deborah Ball. Instead of focusing on how well teachers perform, or what knowledge teachers have (or are lacking), these scholars investigate the work of teaching mathematics and its entailments. In the article we focus on the concept of “dilemmas”, which Magdalene Lampert wrote about several decades ago. She considered the teacher as a “dilemma-manager” and aimed at understanding the dilemmas that teachers were faced with in their teaching of mathematics.
</p>

<p>
In this article, we develop an argument about the promise of focusing on dilemmas of teaching mathematics in the Southern African context, where there tends to be a strong focus on what knowledge teachers are lacking, and many studies have a deficit view of teachers. We suggest that shifting the focus toward identifying and exploring dilemmas of mathematics teaching may provide a more productive approach. Below is the abstract of our article:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Background: Learners in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa are underperforming in important subjects such as mathematics, and research in these contexts tends to focus on the lack of resources, insufficient teacher knowledge or poor quality in teaching as explanatory factors. This study has taken a different approach.
</p>

<p>
Aim: The study aimed at exploring how analysis of dilemmas that teachers encounter in the work of teaching mathematics may provide a productive approach to studying mathematics teaching in the African context.
</p>

<p>
Setting: The study was conducted in a rural Malawian Grade 1 classroom, where a teacher was teaching arithmetical notation to young learners.
</p>

<p>
Methods: A case study approach was applied, and data were gathered through video observations and interviews. Inductive analysis of observation data was applied to identify and unpack dilemmas of mathematics teaching.
</p>

<p>
Results: Two inherent dilemmas of the complex work of teaching mathematics have been identified and discussed. One dilemma was to decide when and how to present arithmetical notations in different modalities without losing the mathematical meaning. A second dilemma was to decide how to deal with unexpected learner errors while maintaining the planned focus of the lesson.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: Considering dilemmas of teaching shifts the emphasis from evaluating the teacher to understanding and developing shared understanding of teaching as professional practice.
</p>

<p>
Contribution: The suggested shift in focus acknowledges the challenges of the local context without reverting to deficit views, and it contributes to developing a shared professional language.

  <title><![CDATA[New review article published]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
I have recently published a review of research on mathematical knowledge for teaching in Africa. The full title of the article is “Mathematical knowledge for teaching in Africa 2014–2021: A review of literature”, and the article is published in African Journal of Teacher Education and Development.
</p>

<p>
The article provides a systematic review of research, and the entire review process (including search criteria, coding, and analysis) is available in a public Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/rmosvold/mkt-africa">https://github.com/rmosvold/mkt-africa</a>
</p>

<p>
Below is the structured abstract of the review article:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Background: A previous review of literature on mathematical knowledge for teaching in Africa indicated that most studies were small, qualitative studies that did not apply existing measures. The present literature review explores trends in more recent research from 2014 to 2021.
</p>

<p>
Aim: The aim of the literature review is to investigate trends in peer-reviewed journal articles on mathematical knowledge for teaching in Africa from 2014 to 2021.
</p>

<p>
Setting: A literature review of research on mathematical knowledge for teaching in Africa between 2014–2021.
</p>

<p>
Methods: After a three-step search and initial coding, 24 studies were included in the review. Studies were coded in terms of genre, type of study, research problem, sample size, instruments, level and experience of teachers, location of the study and frameworks applied.
</p>

<p>
Results: As compared with the previous literature review, there was variation in sample size, genre of the studies, as well as in the level and experience of participating teachers, and this indicates a field in positive development. Yet, there is a significant geographical lack of balance, as most studies were conducted in South Africa. In addition, there is a predominance of studies that investigate what knowledge teachers have, and many studies provide a deficit view of teachers’ lack of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: Based on the trends in the studies reviewed, a shift in focus from teachers and their (lack of) knowledge to the knowledge demands of teaching is suggested.
</p>

<p>
Contribution: An emphasis on exploring what is involved in teaching mathematics in African contexts might provide a productive turn in research that would be of international interest and significance.

Welcome to my new website! After many years of having my web site hosted with Wordpress, I decided to try another and more Emacs-friendly solution, by using org-static-blog and Github Pages. Let's see how this works!
