<p>
It has been a while since <a href="https://www.icme14.org/static/en/index.html?v=28960409819">ICME-14</a>, but the proceedings have now finally been published. In volume II, among the invited lectures, is my review of literature on discussion in mathematics teaching. Based on a systematic search in Eric, and on searches in major journals of mathematics education, I reviewed 72 peer-reviewed articles on discussion in mathematics teaching, which were published between 2000 and 2020. Below is the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For decades, reformers have emphasized discussion over recitation and lecture. Yet, traditional communication patterns are still dominant in mathematics classrooms internationally. In an effort to better understand this challenge, the present study investigates patterns and contributions of research on discussion in mathematics teaching. Based on systematic search in the Eric database, and in selected journals of mathematics education, 72 studies were reviewed. Based on analysis and discussion of the reviewed studies, it is suggested to develop conceptual clarity and include definitions of core terms like discussion, to consider alternative methods for studying discussion in teaching, and to consider shifting the focus from teacher actions to the entailments of the work of leading mathematical discussions.

<p>
The <a href="https://euromathsoc.org/">European Mathematical Society</a> (EMS) <a href="https://euromathsoc.org/magazine">Magazine</a> has a column with news from the European Society for Research in Mathematics Education (<a href="http://erme.site/">ERME</a>). In the upcoming issue, this column contains a <a href="https://doi.org/10.4171/mag/171">brief report</a> of the activities from Thematic Working Group 19 (TWG19), on <i>Mathematics Teaching and Teacher Practice(s)</i>, which I am leading. In this report, you can read about the focus of our working group—and how it is positioned in the field of research on  mathematics teaching—the history of the group, and current efforts in the group. If you are interested in research on mathematics teaching, or in learning more about the work in our group, I recommend reading this brief paper!

<p>
The <a href="https://cerme13.renyi.hu/">CERME 13 conference</a> was held in Budapest, Hungary, in 2023. Even though the conference was arranged in the summer (July 10–14), the organizers have been able to finish the conference proceedings in record time. The full proceedings are now available at: <a href="http://erme.site/cerme-proceedings-series/">http://erme.site/cerme-proceedings-series/</a>
</p>

<p>
As the leader of TWG19, I obviously recommend the papers from that group, but there are many interesting papers to read, and the full proceedings constitute more than 5,000 pages. Happy reading!

Some articles take longer than others to publish. I have recently published a new article in Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education (Hoover et al., 2023). We started working on this study when I had my sabbatical in Michigan in 2017–2018, so this one has been in the making for a long time. Matt and I spent a lot of time with the initial analyses and work, then Mark came along and took a leader role in the study, and Imani joined the team a bit later. After I moved back to Norway in August 2018, the three of us had weekly Zoom meetings where we worked on analysis and later writing for a long time. Along the way, we developed, presented and published two CERME papers on preliminary parts of this work (Dahlgren et al., 2019, 2022). It is therefore a great pleasure to finally see the finished article in print! You can find the abstract of the article below:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Recent scholarship has explored mathematical demands faced by mathematics teacher educators and ways to support their development, but little attention has been given to the basic question of how mathematics teacher educators think about content knowledge for teaching. Knowing what they think could inform efforts to support them. Our analysis reveals that some think about mathematical knowledge for teaching as an independent, abstracted resource to be taught and learned in relative isolation from teaching, while others think about it as dynamic, situated work. We argue that this key difference matters for how they work with teachers. Further, our analysis reveals that their thinking about both teaching and justice interacts with their thinking about mathematical knowledge for teaching and that their thinking in these other two domains can be a resource for supporting their mathematical development.

<p>
I have recently published a new article entitled, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073231232300007X?via%3Dihub">Teacher time out as a site for studying mathematical knowledge for teaching</a>” with my colleagues <a href="https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/kjersti.wage">Kjersti Wæge</a> and <a href="https://www.uis.no/nb/profile/janne-fauskanger">Janne Fauskanger</a>. The article is going to be published in an upcoming special issue of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-journal-of-mathematical-behavior">The Journal of Mathematical Behavior</a>, but it is already available online (open access). This article developed from an ICME-paper we presented at the recent <a href="https://icme14.org/static/en/index.html?v=86498275436">ICME 14</a>. In this article, we develop a theoretical argument for why and how “teacher time outs” might be an interesting site for studying mathematical knowledge for teaching. The article draws on illustrative data from the Mastering Ambitious Mathematics teaching (MAM) project. A link to the Norwegian project web site can be found <a href="https://www.matematikksenteret.no/kompetanseutvikling-i-skolen/mam/om-mam-prosjektet">here</a>. Below is the abstract of our article and full reference in APA format. I hope you enjoy reading it just as much as we enjoyed writing it!

<blockquote>
<p>
The special mathematical knowledge that is needed for teaching has been studied for decades but the methods for studying it have challenges. Some methods, such as measurement and cognitive interviews, are removed from the dynamics of teaching. Other methods, such as observation, are closer to practice but mostly involve an outsider perspective. Moreover, few methods tap into the tacit and often invisible demands that teachers encounter in teaching. This article develops an argument that teacher time outs in rehearsals and enactments might be a productive site for studying mathematical knowledge for teaching. Teacher time outs constitute a site for professional deliberation, which 1) preserves the complexity and gets inside the dynamics of teaching, where 2) tacit and implicit challenges and demands are made explicit, and where 3) insider and outsider perspectives are combined.
