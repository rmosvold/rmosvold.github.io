My name is Reidar Mosvold, and I am [[https://www.uis.no/nb/profile/1982][professor of mathematics education]] at the University of Stavanger and [[https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/reidamo][professor II at NTNU]], the Norwegian Centre for Mathematics Education. My research mainly concentrates on developing mathematics teaching. I consider mathematics teaching to be a professional practice, and am interested in the mathematical demands that are embedded in the work of teaching. For over a decade, I have investigated the complexities involved in the work of teaching mathematics, attributes that influence this work—mainly teachers’ knowledge and beliefs, but also their identity and mathematical communication—and the development of mathematics teachers, both pre-service and in-service. My present research interests revolve around the following three areas:
1. what it means to be “smart” in mathematics and teachers’ positioning of students,
2. the work of leading mathematical discussions, and
3. methods for studying mathematics teaching.
