I have recently published a new article entitled, “[[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073231232300007X?via%3Dihub][Teacher time out as a site for studying mathematical knowledge for teaching]]” with my colleagues [[https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/kjersti.wage][Kjersti Wæge]] and [[https://www.uis.no/nb/profile/janne-fauskanger][Janne Fauskanger]]. The article is going to be published in an upcoming special issue of [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-journal-of-mathematical-behavior][The Journal of Mathematical Behavior]], but it is already available online (open access). This article developed from an ICME-paper we presented at the recent [[https://icme14.org/static/en/index.html?v=86498275436][ICME 14]].
